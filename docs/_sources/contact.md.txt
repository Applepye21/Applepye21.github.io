# **Contact**

If you ever need to reach me, you can use one of the following methods:


## **Email**

mjpye157@gmail.com

This is usually the best method to contact me as I check my email daily.


## **Phone**

(339) 234-4457

Please leave a message if I do not pick up and I will call you back as soon as I can. I rarely answer calls from numbers I do not already have saved in my contacts. If you leave a message, I am good about returning calls so this is a great method of contact for me as well.


## **LinkedIn**

## **GitHub**

[https://github.com/Applepye21](https://github.com/Applepye21)

This is not a good way to reach me but it can be useful to access more of the collaborative work I have done.
