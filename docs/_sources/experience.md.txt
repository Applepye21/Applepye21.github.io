# **Employment History**

## **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency**

***Air Quality Researcher and Data Scientist***  
***December 2024 - May 2025***

At the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, I worked as a contractor employed by [Oak Ridge Associated Universities](https://www.orau.org/) (ORAU). I was a part of the [Atmospheric and Environmental Systems Modeling Division (CMAQ)](https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/about-atmospheric-and-environmental-systems-modeling-division) assisting in the development of the [Community Multiscale Air Quality](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq) model. While in this position I:

* Created and deployed a [documentation website](https://usepa.github.io/CRACMM/) for the Community Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Multiphase Mechanism (CRACMM) on GitHub Pages using Sphinx Python software and C-shell scripting in a Linux environment

* Developed a Python tool for comparing atmospheric chemistry observations from aircraft to CMAQ model output. Click [here](projects.md#cmaq-flighteval) for more details on the tool.

* Assisted model development by analyzing output data from CMAQ to evaluate the model’s performance and determine where to focus attention to address errors. Some of this work is included in an [article](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-fx8f1) that has been submitted for publication in the ChemRxiv journal.

* Collaborated with agency scientists to advance CMAQ performance research and CRACMM website development, presenting on each topic during branch and division-wide meetings

Unfortunately, due to restructuring at the EPA, my contract expired in May 2025 and was not renewed, putting me out of work.

## **The University of Utah - Department of Atmospheric Science**

***Research Assistant***   
***June 2022 - August 2024***

At the University of Utah, I was a fully funded graduate student pursuing a master's degree in Atmospheric Science under the supervision of [Dr. Zhaoxia Pu](https://www.inscc.utah.edu/~pu/). My role as a research assistant was to investigate drought in the western United States during 2021 and 2022. Overall, I addressed three topics related to the drought:

1. What were the synoptic scale atmospheric features present at seasonal time scales that led to drought conditions during the summer and winter of 2021 and 2022 across the Pacific coastal states and the Inter-Mountain West?

2. How did soil moisture respond to the drought and how did the response vary between different [Köppen climate zones](https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/global/climate-zones)? 

3. Is it possible that drought in the northwest United States can influence the [North American Monsoon](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/north-american-monsoon), manipulating the amount of precipitation in the southwest United States during the summer and early fall? If so, did the drought during 2021 and 2022 drive an intensification of the monsoon, creating wetter conditions across the Southwest and ameliorating drought conditions in the region?

All three topics were included in my [master's thesis](https://www.proquest.com/openview/7bafda29ae4604f4f3ffdee752db216e/1?cbl=18750&diss=y&pq-origsite=gscholar). Most of the work done to address the first topic, was included in an article published in August of 2025 in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology titled [*The Synoptic-Scale Circulation during the Western U.S. Drought of 2021 and 2022*](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/64/8/JAMC-D-24-0059.1.xml).

As a research assistant, I:

* Sourced a variety of datasets to address the research questions that I developed. These data were often in [GRIB](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/What+are+GRIB+files+and+how+can+I+read+them) or [NetCDF](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) formats and were arranged into either 2-D or 3-D grids. Some examples include:

    * [European Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=download)
    * [North American Mesoscale (NAM) Analysis](https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d609000/)
    * [Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP)](https://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/data/)

* Ran the [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) model to investigate drought in the western United States. I produced over 20 simulations in total, many containing several months of model output.

* Created Python packages to process, manipulate, quality control, and visualize environmental datasets in a Linux environment. Sometimes, these Python packages were designed to process up to 25 TB at a time, requiring an emphasis on code efficiency. Click [here](projects.md#north-american-mesoscale-nam-analysis-data-extraction) to learn more about these packages.

* Analyzed the processed datasets and produced a wide variety of maps, graphs, charts, and animations using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

* Published research manuscripts based on my findings

* Collaborated with my supervisor and other members of my research group to improve our work and provide feedback on other projects 

* Presented the results of my work at three [American Meteorological Society](https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/) conferences in both poster and slide show formats

    * [Madison, WI July 2023 poster presentation abstract](https://ams.confex.com/ams/WAFNWPMS/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/425303)
    * [Baltimore, MD January 2024 oral presentation abstract](https://ams.confex.com/ams/104ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/437853)
    * [New Orleans, LA January 2025 oral presentation abstract](https://ams.confex.com/ams/105ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/454223)

***Research Associate***  
***September 2024 - November 2024***

After graduation, I was promoted from a research assistant to a research associate. In this role, I continued to develop my research on drought in the West, primarily adding to my work done on drought-monsoon relationships and preparing two articles for publication.

I left this position voluntarily during November 2024 after completing all tasks set before me and accepting a position as a contractor at the EPA.  

## **Plymouth State University - Office of Academic Support Services**

***Math and Physics Tutor***  
***September 2021 - May 2022***

At the start of my senior year of college my professor for Atmospheric Dynamics recommended I become the tutor for the course. This began a year at Plymouth State's [Office of Academic Support Services](https://www.plymouth.edu/academics/plymouth-academic-support-services) where I tutored physics students and some calculus students. The students were all paired to work with me one on one. I had at least one student at a time throughout the year, and I regularly met with each student once or twice a week for either an hour or an hour and a half.

I left this position when I graduated college and moved to Utah.

## **Plymouth State University - Math Activities Center**

***Math Tutor***  
***August 2019 - December 2019***

After my freshman year calculus professor recommended that I become a math tutor, I joined Plymouth State's Math Activity Center (MAC). I worked at the Center during the fall of my sophomore year, assisting students that arrived looking for help with algebra, pre-calculus, and calculus. Students who came in were drop-ins without appointments, often requiring me to be working with multiple students at a time, each with different sets of coursework.

Unfortunately, I was unable to fit tutoring into my schedule during the spring semester of 2020, ending my time at the MAC.
